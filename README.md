Hi , I'm a data analyst with a keen interest in Python programming. 
While I may not be a professional developer, I appreciate Python's versatility in solving a wide range of challenges.
I've chosen GitHub as the platform to share a collection of Python scripts I've created. 
They serve to automate specific tasks and reflect my journey to advance my programming skills.
Feel free to explore my projects, your feedback and potential collaborations are always welcome!
